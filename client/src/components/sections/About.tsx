              I'm a Graduate Student by day, Machine Learning & AI Explorer by night (and sometimes the other way around). 
              My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and web development, 
              and I'm energized by the prospect of turning cutting-edge technology into real-world solutions. 
              I thrive on collaboration, and I'm always game to join forces with dynamic teams to create impactful AI/ML applications and innovative software. 
              Let's shape the futureâ€”one algorithm at a time!
